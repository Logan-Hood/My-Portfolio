                    <h1>Limitless Baseball</h1>
                    <p> A youth baseball training facility in Utah, needed a modern, user-friendly website to enhance credibility and increase customer engagement. Through strategic user research and a complete UI overhaul, I developed a responsive and visually appealing platform that streamlined navigation and improved accessibility. The redesign led to a significant increase in inquiries and bookings, helping the facility establish stronger relationships with aspiring athletes and their families. This project demonstrates my ability to balance business goals with user needs, ensuring a seamless and engaging digital experience.

                    <p>The Reef Life Foundation is dedicated to restoring marine ecosystems, but their outdated website struggled to effectively communicate their impact and drive donor engagement.
