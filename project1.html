                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                  Limitless Baseball is a small business owned and operated out of Clearfield, Utah. Their goal is to help kids learn the fundamentals of baseball and teach valuable lessons they can use on and off the diamond. Being in the baseball community in Utah his whole life, the owner, Breck Snyder, already had a few clients eager to sign up for lessons when they first opened their doors in May 2023. They needed to move fast so instead of getting a professional website done, Breck used Wix just to have something in place for his clients. So far Limitless Baseball has done really well, and received a lot of new business from referrals but now they want they want to create an image for themselves that oozes credibility and doesn’t rely on referrals alone for new business.

                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>
                  Recently, Limitless Baseball has received feedback from parents who felt reluctant to sign their child up for lessons at the facility due to a cluttered website that in their words, “lacked credibility.” This makes it hard to attract new clients who might come across Limitless Baseball on Google rather than being referred. Parents want to know their kids are being left in good hands when they drop them off and Limitless Baseball’s current website doesn’t do a good enough job of sending that message. The saving grace so far has been that there’s not much competition in the area and the competition that is around also has fairly lack luster websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Limitless Baseball sees this as an opportunity to set themselves apart and be the leader in their community for sports training facilities.

                <h2>Research Approach</h2>
                <p>
                    To best determine what will inspire our users (parents) to sign their kids up for lessons at Limitless Baseball, we will interview 5 past users. We want to determine how they felt 
                    when they first signed their kids up for lessons and what type of features would have increased their confidence. From there, we will take the criteria that we establish as important 
                    and evaluate some direct and indirect competitors. We want to see how/if they are implementing the important criteria on their sites and potentially find other ideas that will inspire 
                    us in our redesign.

                    2. Determine opportunities to set ourselves apart from the competition and be a leader in the community

                <h2>User Interviews Findings</h2>
                <p>
                    After talking to users (parents), I learned a lot about how people find and experience Limitless Baseball’s website. Most users came across it through word-of-mouth or online searches, but their first impressions pointed out issues with the design feeling outdated and cluttered. A lot of feedback focused on adding things to build trust, like coach bios, social media links, and a clearer layout. Based on this, I’m recommending a redesign to make the site look more modern, easier to navigate, and more trustworthy overall.

                    <br>
                    2. Skepticism: Due to the design, a few users felt initial skepticism about the site's professionalism and credibility.                </p>

                    1. Clarity: While the layout was deemed straightforward by some, others found it overwhelming due to cluttered information, especially on the homepage.
                    <br>
                    2. Content Gaps: Users noted inconsistencies, such as large empty spaces juxtaposed with densely packed sections.

                                                If you clicked the “Live Site” button, you probably noticed we added an Announcement Center section that wasn’t included in the initial prototype. This addition came after the client, Breck, chose to forgo traditional user testing and instead rely on direct feedback from his clients, leveraging the strong relationships he has built with them. After two months of conversations and allowing users time to settle into the new site, we identified three key pieces of feedback that guided meaningful improvements.
                                              </p>

                                              <div class="section">
                                                <h2>User Feedback</h2>
                                                <p>
                                                  1. Lessons get booked up too fast for clinics and one on ones.
                                                  <br>
                                                  2. There's no indication of when the calendar will be open for 1:1 sessions and new clinics announcements.
                                                  <br>
                                                  3. It’s confusing that the clinic button is available even when there are no clinics scheduled.
                                                </p>

                                                <h2>Proposed Updates</h2>
                                                <p>
                                                  1. Add a waitlist for when the books are full that starts over monthly. Those on the waitlist will be called when cancelations occur.
                                                  <br>
                                                  2. Add an announcment center that will update users on when their will be availability for clinics and 1:1 sessions.
                                                  <br>
                                                  3. Remove the button leading to the clinic sign up sheet when there are no clinic scheduled.
                                                </p>
                                              </div>

                                                  It was very easy to address all of these user issues by simply adding an Announcement Center that addressed all 3 pieces of feedback.
